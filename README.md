# [M] Lab â€” Masked Emergent AGI Lab

**[M] Lab (Masked Emergent AGI Lab)** is a research group exploring the next generation of general-purpose AI systems built on the principle of masking. Our mission is to advance efficient, safe, and unified modeling through masked generative and discriminative learning.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

- ðŸ§  **Masked modeling** in vision, language, and multimodality  
- ðŸŒ€ **Discrete diffusion** and non-autoregressive generation  
- ðŸ§© **Unified architectures** for scalable generalization  
- ðŸ§­ **Mask-based pathways** to AGI-aligned reasoning

We believe **masking is a fundamental abstraction** toward controllable, efficient, and generalizable intelligence.
